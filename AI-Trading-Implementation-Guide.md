## 💻 Technical Implementation Details

### AI Prompt Engineering

The system uses carefully crafted prompts for the Gemini API to analyze charts:

```typescript
// Simplified example of a prompt structure
const prompt = `
Analyze the provided chart data for ${pair} on the ${timeframe} timeframe.
Consider the following technical indicators:
${indicators.map((i) => `- ${i.name}: ${i.value}`).join("\n")}

Based on the strategy "${strategy.name}", which follows these rules:
${strategy.rules.map((r) => `- ${r.condition} => ${r.action}`).join("\n")}

Generate a trading signal with:
1. Signal type (BUY/SELL/NEUTRAL)
2. Confidence level (0-100%)
3. Entry price
4. Stop loss level
5. Take profit target
6. Risk assessment
7. Detailed reasoning
`;
```

### WebSocket Implementation

The WebSocket service provides real-time market updates:

```typescript
// Subscription example
function subscribeToMarketData(pair, timeframe, callback) {
  const ws = new WebSocket(`wss://api.example.com/ws`);

  ws.onopen = () => {
    ws.send(
      JSON.stringify({
        type: "subscribe",
        pair,
        timeframe,
      })
    );
  };

  ws.onmessage = (event) => {
    const data = JSON.parse(event.data);
    callback(data);
  };

  return () => {
    ws.close();
  };
}
```

### Position Sizing Algorithm

```typescript
function calculatePositionSize(accountBalance: number, riskPercentage: number, entryPrice: number, stopLossPrice: number): number {
  // Calculate the risk amount in account currency
  const riskAmount = accountBalance * (riskPercentage / 100);

  // Calculate the price difference between entry and stop loss
  const priceDifference = Math.abs(entryPrice - stopLossPrice);

  // Calculate position size
  const positionSize = riskAmount / priceDifference;

  return positionSize;
}
```
