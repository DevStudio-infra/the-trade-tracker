# AI-Powered Trading Feature

## Overview

The AI-Powered Trading feature in The Trade Tracker allows users to leverage artificial intelligence for market analysis, trading signal generation, and automated trade execution. This feature integrates with users' broker accounts to provide a seamless trading experience while maintaining full control over risk parameters.

## Key Features

- **AI Chart Analysis**: Analyze market charts with custom prompts
- **Trading Signals**: Generate trading signals based on AI analysis
- **Automated Execution**: Option to automatically execute trades based on signals
- **Position Management**: Track open positions and close them when ready
- **Broker Integration**: Connect to your trading broker of choice
- **Risk Management**: Control risk per trade with configurable parameters
- **Trade History**: Review all executed trades and their performance

## Architecture

The AI trading feature is built with a modular architecture:

1. **Frontend**:

   - Chart visualization with TradingView's Lightweight Charts
   - Position management interface
   - Trading configuration panel

2. **Backend**:
   - Authentication & authorization via Clerk
   - Credits system for controlling AI usage
   - Trading execution engine
   - Broker API integration layer
   - Redis caching for performance

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+
- Redis server
- Broker API credentials (or use mock mode)
- Clerk account for authentication

### Setup

1. Install dependencies:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Configure environment variables:

   ```
   CLERK_SECRET_KEY=your_clerk_secret
   REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379
   DATABASE_URL=your_database_connection_string
   ```

3. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm run dev
   ```

## Usage Guide

### Basic Workflow

1. **Select a Broker**: Choose from your connected broker accounts
2. **Select a Trading Pair**: Choose the instrument you want to analyze
3. **Configure Analysis**: Set your analysis parameters and risk level
4. **Run Analysis**: Generate trading signals with AI
5. **Review & Execute**: Review the analysis and execute trades if desired
6. **Manage Positions**: Monitor and close positions from the positions panel

### Trading Modes

- **Manual Mode**: AI generates signals but doesn't execute trades
- **Semi-Automated**: AI executes trades after user confirmation
- **Fully Automated**: AI executes trades automatically based on signals

## Credit System

Each AI analysis costs a certain number of credits:

- Basic Analysis: 1 credit
- Detailed Analysis: 3 credits
- Analysis with Signal: 5 credits
- Analysis with Execution: 10 credits

Premium subscribers receive discounted credit costs and higher daily limits.

## Security Considerations

- All broker credentials are encrypted at rest
- Authentication is required for all trading operations
- Trading permissions are validated for each operation
- Rate limiting is applied to prevent API abuse

## Testing

Two test scripts are provided to verify functionality:

- `test-ai-trading-ui.js`: Manual testing instructions for UI components
- `test-api-endpoints.js`: API endpoint testing script

## Troubleshooting

Common issues:

1. **Authentication Errors**: Ensure Clerk is properly configured
2. **Broker Connection Issues**: Verify credentials and network connectivity
3. **Execution Failures**: Check credit balance and broker limitations
4. **Missing Data**: Ensure Redis is running for caching

## Roadmap

Future enhancements planned:

- Webhook integrations for third-party signals
- Mobile push notifications for trade alerts
- Additional broker integrations
- Enhanced backtesting capabilities
- Portfolio analytics dashboard
