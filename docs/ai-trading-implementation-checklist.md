## Completed During Current Session

- [x] Created comprehensive UI testing script
- [x] Developed API endpoint testing tools
- [x] Created implementation checklist
- [x] Added documentation README
- [x] Fixed component integration issues

## Known Issues & Next Steps

- [ ] Fix any 'any' type usages in the API client
- [ ] Add proper error handling for broker API connectivity issues
- [ ] Implement proper WebSocket handling for real-time position updates
- [ ] Add more comprehensive test coverage
- [ ] Connect to actual broker APIs (currently using mock implementations)
- [ ] Implement stop-loss monitoring service
- [ ] Add reporting and analytics dashboard for trade performance

## Deployment Considerations

- Make sure Redis is configured correctly in production
- Set up proper environment variables for Clerk authentication
- Ensure proper rate limiting on API endpoints
- Configure proper monitoring for the execution engine
- Set up backup strategy for the database
