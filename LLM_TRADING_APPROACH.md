# LLM-Based Trading Approach

## Overview

The trading bot implements an advanced approach using Large Language Models (LLM) for trade analysis and decision making, moving away from traditional technical indicators to a more sophisticated AI-driven strategy.

## Core Components

### 1. Chart Image Generation

- At each timeframe interval, the system generates chart images
- Images capture price action, volume, and market context
- Multiple timeframes are analyzed for a comprehensive view

### 2. LLM Analysis Process

- Chart images are sent to LLM along with:
  - Strategy details and parameters
  - Current market conditions
  - Account risk parameters
  - Historical performance context
- LLM provides detailed analysis and trading decisions
- All images and LLM responses are stored in Supabase for:
  - Trade documentation
  - Performance analysis
  - Strategy refinement
  - Audit trails

### 3. Trading Decisions

The LLM is responsible for all major trading decisions:

- Entry points
- Exit points
- Stop-loss placement
- Take-profit targets
- Position sizing recommendations
- Stop-loss adjustments during trade

## Risk Management Integration

### Position Sizing Strategy

The system implements a hybrid approach to position sizing:

1. **User-Defined Risk Parameters**

   - Maximum risk per trade (e.g., 2% of account)
   - Maximum number of concurrent positions
   - Overall portfolio risk limits

2. **LLM Risk Assessment**
   The LLM analyzes trade opportunities and assigns a risk rating that determines the actual position size:

   - High Conviction Trade: Uses full allowed risk (e.g., 2% of account)
   - Medium Conviction Trade: Uses half of allowed risk (e.g., 1% of account)
   - Low Conviction Trade: Uses quarter of allowed risk (e.g., 0.5% of account)

3. **Dynamic Position Sizing**
   - Position size is calculated based on:
     - LLM-determined stop-loss distance
     - Trade conviction level
     - Account risk parameters
   - Formula: Position Size = (Account Size √ó Risk Percentage √ó Conviction Level) √∑ Stop Loss Distance

### Example

```
Account Size: $10,000
Max Risk per Trade: 2% ($200)
Stop Loss Distance: 100 pips
Trade Conviction: High (100% of max risk)

Position Size = ($10,000 √ó 0.02 √ó 1.0) √∑ 100 pips
```

## Storage and Documentation

- All trading decisions are stored with:
  - Chart images used for analysis
  - LLM reasoning and analysis
  - Risk assessment and conviction level
  - Position sizing calculations
  - Final trade parameters

## Benefits

1. **Adaptive Risk Management**

   - Position sizing adapts to market conditions
   - Risk is proportional to opportunity quality
   - Preserves capital in uncertain conditions

2. **Transparent Decision Making**

   - All decisions are documented with LLM reasoning
   - Clear audit trail for performance review
   - Helps in strategy refinement

3. **Comprehensive Analysis**
   - Multiple timeframe analysis
   - Market context consideration
   - Integration of technical and contextual factors

## Implementation Notes

- LLM prompts must include all relevant risk parameters
- System should validate LLM decisions against maximum risk limits
- Regular performance review of LLM decision quality
- Continuous refinement of prompts and analysis parameters
