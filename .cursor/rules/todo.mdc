# Trade Tracker Todo List

## Critical Fixes
- [ ] Fix multiple pane issues in chart

  - Potential solution might involve custom pane management

## Features
- [ ] Enable multiple indicator support
  - Allow multiple indicators in main chart pane
  - Implement proper pane separation for oscillator indicators
  - Add UI feedback when max indicators reached

## Temporary Restrictions
- [x] Limit to single oscillator indicator in bottom pane
- [x] Allow multiple indicators in main chart pane only

## UI/UX Improvements
- [ ] Add visual feedback when indicator limit is reached
- [ ] Improve indicator selection UI
- [ ] Add indicator removal confirmation

## Documentation
- [ ] Document indicator pane management system
- [ ] Add inline code comments for pane creation logic
- [ ] Update README with indicator limitations
